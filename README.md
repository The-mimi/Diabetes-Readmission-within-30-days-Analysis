# Diabetes-Readmission-within-30-days-Analysis
This analysis investigates 30-day hospital readmissions among diabetic patients, a population at elevated risk due to the chronic nature of the disease. Frequent readmissions often signal gaps in care quality. We identified patterns and risk factors contributing to early readmissions, enabling targeted interventions to improve outcomes.

- Key risk factors identified in research for 30-day readmissions among diabetic patients include:

- Patient demographics such as age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status.

- Hospitalization characteristics: type of admission, length of stay, discharge status, and recent prior hospitalizations.

- Clinical factors such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, anemia diagnosis, comorbid conditions, and insulin use before admission.

- Social and behavioral factors including employment status, alcohol and tobacco use, housing stability, and social support.

- Post-discharge factors like failure to attend follow-up outpatient visits significantly increase readmission risk.
